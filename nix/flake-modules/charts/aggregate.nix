# Chart aggregate flake-module (Phase 3)
# Copyright Firestream. MIT License.
#
# The chart-side mirror of nix/flake-modules/aggregate.nix. Collects every chart
# registered in `config.firestreamCharts` into a single symlink-farm derivation
# at `packages.firestream-charts-bundle` and emits an `index.json` at the root
# that catalogues both per-chart manifest paths and named stacks.
#
# The Rust deploy layer (Agent D, next phase) mounts this derivation's $out as
# its `/opt/firestream/charts/` default via a clap fallback. It then reads
# `index.json` to discover available charts/stacks and resolves each chart's
# `chart-manifest.json` by joining the manifest path against the farm root.
#
# DESIGN:
#   - The registry option `config.firestreamCharts` is `lazyAttrsOf raw`, so it
#     auto-expands as Wave-3 chart flake-modules land (postgresql/redis/kafka/
#     spark/jupyterhub/superset/odoo). Phase 3 only ships airflow; the others
#     simply aren't in the attrset yet, and the loop here picks up whatever is
#     present at evaluation time.
#   - Stacks may reference charts that aren't yet registered. The `dev` stack
#     declared below lists the full target stack; charts that have no entry in
#     `firestreamCharts` are recorded in `index.json` under `stacks` but
#     receive no symlink. The Rust reader handles missing charts at the
#     resolution layer, not here.
#   - We filter `firestreamCharts` to entries that actually carry a
#     `chartBundle` attribute before iterating, so a partially-registered
#     entry (no chartBundle yet) is skipped gracefully rather than crashing
#     the symlink farm.
#   - `index.json` paths are RELATIVE to the farm root (`$out`). That keeps
#     them stable across mount points (the Rust runtime may bind-mount the
#     farm anywhere). The reader resolves via `farm_root.join(manifest_path)`.
#
# Like nix/flake-modules/charts/checks.nix, this module does NOT gate on
# `config.firestreamCharts ? <n>` at the option-emission level (that would be
# self-referential and infinitely recur through flake-parts' option-merge).
# All references to the registry happen lazily inside the runCommand.
