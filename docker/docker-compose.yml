    # Configure DNS resolution to use the internal IP address assigned to the KinD Control Plane
    # This allows internal Kubernetes services (which have arbitrary IP address assignments) to be addressed using DNS (i.e. name.svc.cluster.local)
    # NOTE: This will make the internet inaccessible until the KinD Control Plane has created and connected via the "bootstrap.sh" command
