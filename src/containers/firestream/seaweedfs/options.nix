# Externalized, declarative configuration for the SeaweedFS container, consumed

# direct-import path.
#
# SeaweedFS is the Firestream object store (9th supported app): a single Go
# binary (`weed`) providing an S3-compatible API. It is NOT a Bitnami chart and
# never sources /opt/bitnami/scripts/lib*.sh, so there are no per-container
# helpers / config / init scripts — the container is simply "weed on PATH".
#
# SINGLE-VERSION: unlike redis/postgresql there is no N/M split, so `version` is
# pinned here directly.
#
# IMPORTANT: env defaults use a PER-LEAF mkDefault (each value wrapped
# individually). A single mkDefault around the whole attrset would be replaced
# wholesale when a consumer overrides one key, silently dropping siblings.
