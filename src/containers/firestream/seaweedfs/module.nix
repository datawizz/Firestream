# SeaweedFS Container Module - Using Firestream Factories
# Copyright Firestream. MIT License.
#
# Defines the SeaweedFS container using mkContainerModule. SeaweedFS is the
# Firestream object store (9th supported app): a single Go binary (`weed`)
# exposing an S3-compatible API.
#
# Deliberately MINIMAL. SeaweedFS is NOT a Bitnami chart — its upstream Helm
# chart invokes `weed` directly via a `command:` block and never sources
# /opt/bitnami/scripts/lib*.sh. So the Firestream Bitnami-compat machinery is
# omitted entirely: no perContainerHelpers, no validate/config/init scripts, no
# extraEnvVars path-remap dance. The container is simply "weed on PATH".
#
# The `weed` binary is built by bin/nix/firestream/packages/seaweedfs-weed.nix
# and threaded in here as `seaweedfsWeedPkg` via the flake-module's
# extraFactoryArgs (mirroring superset's waitForPortPkg injection).
#
# Usage:
#   seaweedfsModule = import ./module.nix {
#     inherit pkgs lib firestream seaweedfsWeedPkg;
#   };
