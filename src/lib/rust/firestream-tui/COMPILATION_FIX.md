# Compilation Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **`impl Trait` in trait methods**: Changed to use `BoxFuture<'_, T>` type alias for dynamic dispatch compatibility.

2. **Removed Debug derive**: Removed `#[derive(Debug)]` from `App` struct since `dyn FirestreamBackend` doesn't implement Debug.

3. **Fixed borrow checker issues**: 
   - Changed command parsing to use owned `String`s instead of borrowed `&str`
   - Removed unnecessary async block spawn in toggle_expand

4. **Fixed field name mismatches**: Updated `ResourceUtilization` fields to use correct names (`cpu_usage` instead of `cpu`, etc.)

5. **Updated all trait implementations**: Both `MockClient` and `ApiClient` now use `BoxFuture` return types.

## Remaining Steps

To complete the build, run:

```bash
# Make the start script executable
chmod +x start.sh

# Run the TUI with mock backend
./start.sh --dev
```

The TUI should now compile and run successfully with the mock backend providing sample data.

## Architecture Benefits

The refactored code provides:
- **Type-safe backend abstraction** with dynamic dispatch
- **Clean separation of concerns** between UI and data
- **Easy testing** with mock implementation
- **Extensible design** for adding new resource types
- **Keyboard-first navigation** matching the specification

The TUI is now ready for development and can be extended with real HTTP client implementation when needed.
