# Spark chart options aggregator (Phase 6b - Agent G4)
# Copyright Firestream. MIT License.
#
# Consumed as a NixOS module by `evalChart` (passed via `modules = [ ./nix/default.nix ]`).
# It imports every per-section options module (Phase 6b), each declaring
# `options.spark.<section>.*`, and projects the resolved option tree into
# the engine-declared `config.spark.values` attrset that the values.yaml
# emitter serialises.
#
# The Bitnami spark chart is plain master/worker StatefulSets (NOT the
# Kubernetes spark-operator). Only `common` is vendored.
#
# CRITICAL — the `config` argument MUST be bound in the module signature
# below. `builtins.removeAttrs config.spark [ "_meta" "values" ]` strips
# those two keys BEFORE the recursive filter runs. `_meta`/`values` are
# declared by the engine's stdSchema, so leaving `values` in the tree
# would make `config.spark.values` reference itself (infinite recursion).
# We read every OTHER section, drop nulls recursively, and write the
# result back to `values`.

  # - deployment: same atomic + wait shape as postgresql / redis / kafka.
  #   Spark needs --wait so master + workers reach Ready before downstream
  #   stacks (airflow, jupyterhub) try to submit jobs. 10m timeout covers
  #   image pulls + StatefulSet ordered rollouts.
  # - lifecycle.dependsOn: leaf dependency; nothing in firestreamStacks
  #   currently lists spark as a prerequisite for itself.
  # - lifecycle.lastBreakingVersion: no Rust-side breaking-version handler
  #   exists at helm_lifecycle/charts/spark.rs (the chart isn't even
  #   referenced from there). Leaving null until that lifecycle plumbing
  #   catches up.
  # - containerRefs: no firestreamImages.spark injection yet (Bitnami's
  #   bundled `bitnami/spark` image renders with its default); leaving
  #   empty so the chart renders unchanged.
  # - provenance: framework.nix does not yet plumb inputs.self.rev into
  #   evalChart; both fields stay null.
