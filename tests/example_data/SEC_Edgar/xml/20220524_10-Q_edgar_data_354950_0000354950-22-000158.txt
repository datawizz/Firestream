 Deferred Revenue 
 For products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of May 1, 2022 and January 30, 2022, deferred revenue for products and services was billion and billion, respectively. 
 We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs within of gift card issuance. As of May 1, 2022 and January 30, 2022, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were million and billion, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, was immaterial during the three months ended May 1, 2022 and May 2, 2021.

 Long-Term Debt 
 March 2022 Issuance. In March 2022, we issued tranches of senior notes. 
 The first tranche consisted of million of senior notes due April 15, 2025 (the 2025 notes at a discount of million. Interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022.

Interest on the 2052 notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022. 
 Issuance costs for the March 2022 issuance totaled million. 
 The 2025 notes, 2027 notes, 2032 notes, and 2052 notes may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. Prior to the Par Call Date, as defined in the notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date. On or after the Par Call Date, the redemption price is equal to of the principal amount of the notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all such notes have the right to require us to redeem those notes at of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. 
 The indenture governing the notes does not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indenture governing the notes contains various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. 
 Repayments . In March 2022, we repaid our million senior notes and million floating rate senior notes at maturity. In May 2022, subsequent to the end of our first fiscal quarter, we fully repaid our billion senior notes, which had a maturity date of June 2022, at the Par Call Date for the notes.

 billion at both May 1, 2022 and January 30, 2022. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At May 1, 2022, the fair values of these agreements totaled million, with million recognized in other long-term liabilities and million recognized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. At January 30, 2022, the fair values of these agreements totaled million, with million recognized in other long-term liabilities and million recognized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt. 
 There were no material changes to the other hedging arrangements disclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K, and all related activity was immaterial for the periods presented within this document. 
 Collateral . We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was million as of May 1, 2022, which was recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We did not hold any cash collateral as of May 1, 2022, and cash collateral both held and posted was immaterial as of January 30, 2022.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 The Home Depot, Inc.: 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of May 1, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the three-month periods ended May 1, 2022 and May 2, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 23, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion provides an analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and in the 2021 Form 10-K and with our MD A included in the 2021 Form 10-K. Our MD A includes the following sections:

 Executive Summary 
 The following table presents quarter-to-date highlights of our financial performance: 
 dollars in millions, except per share data Three Months Ended May 1, 2022 May 2, 2021 Net sales 38,908 37,500 Net earnings 4,231 4,145 Diluted earnings per share 4.09 3.86 Net cash provided by operating activities 3,789 6,310 Proceeds from long-term debt, net of discounts 
 3,957 Repayments of long-term debt 1,054 1,390 Repurchases of common stock 2,308 3,788 
 We reported net sales of 38.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net earnings were 4.2 billion, or 4.09 per diluted share. 
 We lost one store in the U.S. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to a fire, resulting in a total store count of 2,316 at May 1, 2022. A total of 311 stores, or 13.4 , were located in Canada and Mexico. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, sales per retail square foot were 621.99. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.4 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 5.5 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which primarily resulted from the strong demand environment, the impact of inflation, and the delayed start to spring. 
 We generated 3.8 billion of cash flow from operations and issued 4.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, during the first three months of fiscal 2022. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of 2.3 billion for share repurchases, repay an aggregate of 2.1 billion of long-term and short-term debt, pay 2.0 billion of dividends, and fund 704 million in capital expenditures. In February 2022, we announced a 15 increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 1.90 per share. 
 Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 45.3 at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 45.1 at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).

 Sales. We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. 
 Net Sales . Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 1.4 billion, or 3.8 , to 38.9 billion from 37.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket, offset by a decrease in comparable customer transactions. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by 23 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.3 of net sales and grew by 3.7 during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in online sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms for their shopping needs. 
 Comparable Sales . Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52 nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Total comparable sales increased 2.2 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, reflecting an 11.2 increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by an 8.4 decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand for new and innovative products. The decrease in comparable customer transactions was primarily due to lapping comparable transactions of 19.1 that we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and the impact of the delayed start to spring in fiscal 2022. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, 11 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales, led by Plumbing, Building Materials, Millwork, and Paint. Our Outdoor and Indoor Garden departments had double-digit negative comparable sales due to the late arrival of spring this year, and our Appliances department had slightly negative comparable sales, which were impacted by a shift in event timing into the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 3.2 to 13.1 billion from 12.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.8 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 34.0 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by investments in our supply chain network, rate and mix pressure from lumber, and higher product and transportation costs offset by the benefit from higher retail prices. 
 Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are composed of SG A and depreciation and amortization. 
 Selling, General Administrative . SG A for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 236 million, or 3.7 , to 6.6 billion from 6.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG A was 17.0 for the first quarter of both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by wage investments for hourly associates as well as increased operational costs, including investments designed to drive efficiencies in our stores. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 19 million, or 3.2 , to 606 million from 587 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.6 for the first quarter of both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business. 
 Interest and Other, net. Interest and other, net, was 369 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 333 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Interest and other, net, as a percentage of net sales was 0.9 for the first quarter of both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting higher interest expense due to higher debt balances during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, offset by leverage from a positive comparable sales environment. 
 Provision for Income Taxes. Our combined effective income tax rate was 23.9 for the first quarter of both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. 
 Diluted Earnings per Share. Diluted earnings per share were 4.09 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 3.86 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in diluted earnings per share was driven by lower diluted shares due to share repurchases, as well as higher net earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To provide clarity about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. 
 Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. 
 The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure): 
 Twelve Months Ended dollars in millions May 1, 2022 May 2, 2021 Net earnings 16,519 14,766 Interest and other, net 1,339 1,326 Provision for income taxes 5,330 4,691 Operating income 23,188 20,783 Income tax adjustment (1) 
 (5,628) (5,012) NOPAT 17,560 15,771 Average debt and equity 38,761 34,970 ROIC 45.3 45.1 
 
 (1) Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At May 1, 2022, we had 2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which 604 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. 
 Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. 
 In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. For fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately 3 billion back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. 
 During the first three months of fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends of 2.0 billion to shareholders. In February 2022, we also announced a 15 increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 1.65 to 1.90 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.

Table of Contents 

 In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 20.0 billion share repurchase authorization, of which 7.4 billion remained available as of May 1, 2022. This new authorization replaced the previous authorization and does not have a prescribed expiration date. During the first three months of fiscal 2022, we had cash payments of 2.3 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases. The amount and continuation of our share repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic environment and business conditions. 
 Debt 
 We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to 3.0 billion. In connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 3.0 billion, which consist of a five-year 2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2023 and a 364-day 1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2022. At May 1, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. 
 We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In March 2022, we issued 4.0 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance are being used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions and other business considerations. In March 2022, we also repaid 1.0 billion of senior notes at maturity. In May 2022, subsequent to the end of our first fiscal quarter, we fully repaid 1.25 billion of senior notes, which had a maturity date in June 2022, at the Par Call Date for the notes. 
 The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements. 
 Cash Flows Summary 
 Operating Activities. Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. 
 Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2.5 billion in the first three months of fiscal 2022 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2021, primarily driven by changes in working capital, slightly offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was primarily impacted by timing of vendor payments, along with higher merchandise inventories at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 resulting from several factors, including product and transportation cost inflation, a high demand environment, actions taken to improve in-stocks, and a delayed start to spring. 
 Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities increased by 173 million in the first three months of fiscal 2022 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2021, primarily resulting from increased capital expenditures. 
 Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities in the first three months of fiscal 2022 primarily reflected 2.3 billion of share repurchases, 2.0 billion of cash dividends paid, 1.1 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and 1.0 billion of repayments for short-term debt, partially offset by 4.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt. Cash used in financing activities in the first three months of fiscal 2021 primarily reflected 3.8 billion of share repurchases, 1.8 billion of cash dividends paid, and 1.4 billion of repayments of long-term debt. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 During the first three months of fiscal 2022, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in the 2021 Form 10-K. Refer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our significant accounting policies. 
 Additional Information 
 For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We are also exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, we may experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks, including the instruments we use to manage our exposure to such risks, from those disclosed in the 2021 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Under the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 1, 2022. 
 We are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative, which includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems. We plan to continue to migrate additional business processes over the course of the next few years and have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as the integration continues. 
 Except as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended May 1, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in the 2021 Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently do not consider material to our business. There have been no material changes in the risk factors discussed in the 2021 Form 10-K.

 (1) These amounts include repurchases pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and our 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the Plans ). Under the Plans, participants may surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. 
 (2) In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 20.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization. This new authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date.

 e. Reformation, Severability, and Blue-Penciling 
 
 If any of the provisions of Section 4(a), 4(b), 5(a) or 5(b) should ever be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the scope permitted by applicable law, you agree such provision or provisions shall first be modified to such lesser scope as the court may deem just and proper for the reasonable protection of the Company s legitimate business interests.
